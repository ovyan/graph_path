# Welcome to Graph Path!
_ _ _
If you have never heard of graphs, you will certaintly be amazed how often you are using them, and what's more, solving the __shortest path problem__.

But what is a __Graph__?
 
* Callout(Math teachers define it as:):
A graph is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects.
_ _ _
Actually, we use graphs everyday, while using Maps on iPhone, searching for new friends on social networks, and many other cases!
 
But why am I telling you all this? Go check out the Intro Playground which will help you to dive into the __world of graphs__!

 Hey, run the Intro Playground here!
